## About this project

The [official tool for configurating the nakedboards MC-8](https://www.nakedboards.org/settings_mc-8m.html?) is cool, but somehow limited: you need to be online to set up your faders (or at least download the webpage and serve it locally) and there is no notion of some kind of CCs bank.

To solve this problem, first of all for my own usage, I coded a very simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) client, whose code you'll find in the present repository.

## Installation
You would of course need some [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Mine was `v14.15.4` when I wrote these lines, and I haven't tested the application with older versions.

First clone the repository, then use for favorite package manager to install the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```
or
```shell
$ yarn install
```

Then populate the `banks.json` file with as many banks as you wish.

They must follow this format:
```
[
    [1, 11],
    [1, 1],
    [2, 11],
    [2, 1],
    [3, 11],
    [3, 1],
    [4, 11],
    [4, 1]
  ],
]
```

...where the first number of the first row is the `MIDI channel` and the `MIDI CC number` for the first fader, and so on...

## Usage

The CLI offers the following command:

```
    -h					Prints this help
    -l	--list			List all banks
    -n	--next			Upload next bank
    -p	--prev			Upload previous bank
    --bank=[number]		Load a specific bank
```

So for instance :

```shell
$ node MC8-MIDI-settings --next
```

... would iterate through the banks in forward.

The settings are immediately uploaded to your nakedboard after a successful command otherwise some error message is displayed in the console.

And that's it!
